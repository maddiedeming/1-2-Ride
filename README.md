## Description
1-2 Ride pulls various ride-sharing service data from Uber and Lyft, based on the current geo-location of the user or user input, and user's destination input. The application then displays the information, comparing ETAs and price estimates, in the form of charts for easy-to-read visible data. User has the option to vote on which service they would use, based on the data provided.
## Notice
The Google Maps API platform has since changed and needs to be updated.
